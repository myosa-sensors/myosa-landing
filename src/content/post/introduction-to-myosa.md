# MYOSA: Make Your Own Sensors Applications

![MYOSA Overview](https://example.com/myosa_overview.jpg) <!-- Replace with actual image link -->

MYOSA (Make Your Own Sensors Applications) is a **plug-and-play, multipurpose, multi-sensor system** designed for learning and developing sensor-based applications. With a modular design reminiscent of a LEGO set, MYOSA allows users to easily connect various components, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Motivation

In a world increasingly driven by technology, the concept of "smart systems" is becoming ubiquitous. From smart cities and homes to health monitoring and agriculture, sensors play a crucial role in making these systems intelligent. MYOSA aims to provide an accessible platform for students and budding engineers to explore this exciting field without getting bogged down in complex wiring and coding.

## Components of MYOSA

The MYOSA kit includes several key components:

1. **Motherboard:** An ESP32-derived open-source micro-controller.
2. **MYOSA Sensorboards:** Plug-and-play sensor modules that can be connected to the motherboard.
3. **MYOSA Actuators:** Modules like LEDs and micromotors for output functionality.
4. **Wireless Connectivity:** 
   - Bluetooth v2.0 (HC-05) for mobile app communication.
   - Plug-and-play WiFi (ESP8266-12E) for cloud connectivity.
5. **Mobile Application:** Provides real-time access to sensor data and graphs.
6. **Firmware:** Open-source code that can be customized for different projects.

## Easy Connections

Connecting sensors and actuators is straightforward. Simply plug the components into the motherboard, and theyâ€™re ready to go! This eliminates the need for complex wiring.

```plaintext
// Example: Basic setup for reading a temperature sensor
#include <DHT.h>

#define DHTPIN 2     // Pin where the DHT sensor is connected
#define DHTTYPE DHT11   // DHT 11

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
  float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
  
  // Check if any reads failed
  if (isnan(humidity) || isnan(temperature)) {
    Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
    return;
  }
  
  Serial.print("Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(humidity);
  Serial.print(" %\t");
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temperature);
  Serial.println(" *C");
  
  delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds before the next reading
}
```

## Mobile Application

The MYOSA mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring sensor data in real-time. Data is transmitted via Bluetooth, allowing you to visualize changes through graphs.
